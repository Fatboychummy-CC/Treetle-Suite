# Treetle Suite

The Treetle Suite is a two-piece automatic log and charcoal farm.
Each piece can be used independently of the other, but they are
"made for each-other".

> [!WARNING]
> The Treetle Suite is still in development, expect minor issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the user interface does nothing. You must manually create
> a config file according to the specifications required. This will
> change in the 1.0.0 update, which will also completely revamp the
> UI itself, from its current basic look.
